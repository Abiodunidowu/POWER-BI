Corona virus has been with us for some time now and it seem more like it will still be here for a very long time even tho the advancement in research and medicine will definitely reduce the amount of fatality that occurs as a result of this virus. I first carried out created a tracking dashboard in May 2020 when the virus had us all in our homes, we were all afraid to go out and we missed our loved ones alot. 

## Tools Used
* Python (Request, BeautifulSoup and Pandas) - Used for scraping data from JHU Github repository and ingesting the data into Power BI
* Power BI for data cleaning, modelling and report building

## Data Source
The data is being pulled from the [John Hopkins University repository on Covid 19]('https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) cases.

## What you will find here
Basically, I pulled data from JHU repo using python so I can get the data flowing into the dashboard once the report refreshes.

## My Procedures
Basically, I will be discussing my thought process and work flow regarding this dashboard. 

1. Data Ingestion
Initially, I decided to Fork the repository then
